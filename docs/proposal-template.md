# Introduction

The application focuses on handling patient/doctor engagement for treatment of patient's health conditions. A web application that enables onboarding patients, management of patient care plan regimen and a dashboard graphically representing the critical information from patients. The application helps monitor health condition of patient based on the survey responses provided by patient.

Doctor onboards a new patient in the system and captures all the demographic data such as age, gender, condition etc. and also contact details to send an invite to the patient for application access. While onboarding a patient, a care plan(survey) gets assigned based on patient's condition . Patient will receive an invite on email which will provide access details to the patient web application. The survey assigned gets triggered on a daily basis on patient dashboard and mandates patient to take the survey and these survey responses are shared with the respective doctor for review. The doctor will view a dashboard that provides an overview of the Survey Results for all of their Patients and the dashboard will provide mechanisms for them to “at a glance” be able to understand where they need to spend their time. Patient dashboard displays tabs which redirect to websites providing medical information based on their health condition. 

# Anticipated Technologies

Frontend : Angular
Backend : Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.

# Method/Approach

* Requirements gathering and building login pages
* Dashboard (Doctor & Patient)
* Integration & Testing (QA)
* Submission 

# Estimated Timeline

* Dashboard has many visual representations and link redirections to websites which can be considered as one of the major milestones which might take three weeks to get it implemented.
* Each diagnosis of a patient is linked with an individual care survey. Displaying respective survey on patient application is another milestone to achieve in two weeks.

# Anticipated Problems
* Presenting the patient survey submissions as pending review by doctor in a table and marking the records as completed once the doctor gets the survey responses reviewed. 
  Collecting the user information and presenting it as a representation. 

* There might be a chance of inadequate requirement specifications
